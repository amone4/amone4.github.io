								We've come a long way from when we first started talking on chatous. You found me when a very dark time in my life had just ended. Uss time socha hi nahi thha ki I'll open up to anyone ever. Aur tujhe milne ki kuchh der baad hi I had a breakdown. Mujhe nahi pta why I did infront of you... But I just did... Maybe felt comfy enough for it... idk. Tabse bas baat hue bina bhi baat kiye jaa rahe hai
								<br>
								Tere saath kyu effortless sa lagta hai? Jab kuchh nahi thhe, tab bhi itni lambi baat kyu ho jaati thhi tujhse? Tujhe harr cheez bta dedna itna natural kyu lagta hai? First time milne parr bhi itna apna-apna kyu lag raha thha? Woh weird phase kyu nahi aaya tere saath? I've learnt in life ki cheezei effortless nahi hoti. People are different, and expecting things to go in sync is unrealistic. But yeh hisaab tere saath kyu break ho jaata hai?

								Before things went south for us, there were two differences I was concerned about. The first was the sense of humour. Ab samajh aaya but, tu comfy nahi thha uss time. Ab hai, aur ab nahi lagta difference, and I just feel like an idiot for expecting you to have been equally comfy about everything as me. The second is the perspective towards life. College mei hosh aane ke baad se khudko fast paced hi consider kiya hai. But the extreme burnout I experienced in the past 6 months has made me realise kitna galat perspective hai yeh. And this change comes back full circle to why I had my first breakdown infront of you. Nobody in this world knows what true happiness is; we're all just trying. But there are some predefined paths which are bound to get you somewhere, and that's what everyone tries to follow. It's not guaranteed though, that you'll be happy with it. So no path is better than the other

								I liked mine, but the past 6 months have made me question it. And it's only because of you I've been able to get through it, warna mujhe sachi samajh hi na aata mere saath kya ho gya. That's why I appreciate you all the more
								<br>
								I adore you more than I'm able to express, and I need you more than you realise. You're the solid bedrock I've longed for, and curse the Gods for making me wait this long
								<br>
								<br>
								I love you ❤️
